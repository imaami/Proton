This software contains wine-mono, parts of which are included under a variety of licenses.

    Parts of Mono (mono/) are variously licensed under the GPL, LGPL, and MIT X11 licenses. All parts are available as LGPL or MIT X11 except for the following:
     * The ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib library is available as GPL with an exception (see mono/mcs/class/ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib/README).
     * mcs/jay is BSD-licensed.

    The Visual Basic class libraries (mono-basic/) are MIT X11. The compiler is LGPL v2.

    OpenTK (opentk/) is MIT X11.

    Lidgren.Network (MonoGame/ThirdParty/Lidgren.Network) is MIT.

    MonoGame uses GamepadConfig, Tao.Sdl, and SDL for its gamepad support. GamepadConfig has a non-free license, so gamepad support is disabled in Wine Mono to eliminate those dependencies.
